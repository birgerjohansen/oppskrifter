PULLED PORK
===========

      1 large joint of pork, such as a hand of pork

      For the marinade:
      2 tbsp honey
      2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
      2 tbsp smoked paprika
      2 tbsp olive oil
      1 whole bulb of garlic, crushed by hand
      Plenty of fresh thyme
      Plenty of fresh rosemary
      2 big pinches of salt
      1 big pinch of pepper
      330ml bottle American pale ale
      Homemade pittas, to serve

Put the pork into an oven tray. Start by scoring the pork along the skin as if
making crackling.  Mix all the marinade ingredients together in a bowl then
cover the pork in the marinade. Rub the sauce and the garlic into the scored
slits in the meat and leave the to marinate overnight.

The next day preheat the oven to 240°C/gas mark 9. Put the pork into the oven
for 20 minutes or until it gets a great colour. After 20 minutes take the meat
out, cover it in tin foil and put it back into the oven at a cooler 140°C/gas
mark 1 for 8 hours to slow roast.

Eight hours later it should pull from the bone and be lovely and tender.  Cut
the pittas open down one side and fill with pulled pork. Drizzle some of the
marinade sauce over the top and serve with coleslaw

Pita bread
----------

      1 tsp dried yeast
      300 ml tepid water
      560g strong white bread flour
      Pinch of salt
      2 good glugs of olive oil


Mix the dried yeast into the warm water and set to one side.  Put the flour into
a bowl, add the salt then mix in the yeasty solution. Add the olive oil and
knead it all together until it is smooth and firm. Leave it to rise for half an
hour.  Once it's risen, cut the dough into 8, shape into balls and roll out on
both sides. You need your oven at the hottest it will go – 240°C/gas mark 9, or
higher if you can.  Put the pittas onto a preheated heavy metal baking tray or
a baking stone and pit them into the hot oven until they blister up - it will be
around 2 minutes. Any longer and they'll start to burn.
